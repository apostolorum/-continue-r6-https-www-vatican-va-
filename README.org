  (105) Jesus said: He who knows father and mother will be called the son of a harlot.

This could be about coming to know both the
Father and the Mother Mary, actually, as a
direct attack against the Vatican, which might
be a false church.

I think this is about coming to know the
Father, and coming to 'know' the spirit of the World.

People can follow either without 'knowing' either one.
